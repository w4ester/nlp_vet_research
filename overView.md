Core Product: AI-Powered Veterinary Triage System

  Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)

  1. Set up NLP infrastructure
    - Implement medical entity recognition for symptoms, conditions, medications
    - Build veterinary-specific language models trained on vet medical records
    - Create species-specific classifiers (dogs, cats, exotics)
  2. Develop urgency classification engine
    - Train models on historical triage data to identify emergency vs non-emergency
    - Build severity scoring algorithms (1-5 scale)
    - Implement real-time symptom assessment

  Phase 2: Integration (Months 3-4)

  3. Connect with practice management systems
    - API integration with existing vet software (IDEXX, eVetPractice)
    - Patient history retrieval and context analysis
    - Automated record updates with triage assessments
  4. Build clinician interface
    - Dashboard showing incoming cases by priority
    - Color-coded urgency indicators (red/yellow/green)
    - One-click access to full patient context

  Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (Months 5-6)

  5. Implement advanced features
    - Predictive wait time estimates
    - Resource allocation recommendations
    - Pattern recognition for disease outbreaks
    - Automated follow-up scheduling
  6. Deploy vendor matching system
    - Directory of AI implementation partners
    - Specialty matching (emergency, dental, surgery)
    - Performance metrics and case studies

  Key Technical Components:

  - NLP Pipeline: Symptom extraction → urgency classification → priority scoring
  - Data Sources: Client descriptions, historical records, vital signs
  - Output: Ranked triage queue with clinical justification
  - Compliance: HIPAA-compliant data handling, veterinary board regulations

  The system helps vets handle 30-40% more cases by automating initial assessment and ensuring critical cases are seen immediately.
