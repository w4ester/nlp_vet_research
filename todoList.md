## PROJECT SUMMARY

### What's Been Built (Prototype Stage)
- **Functional NLP triage system** with 1-5 urgency scoring
- **7,000 synthetic veterinary cases** for training/testing
- **Symptom extraction model** identifying 47+ symptoms across 8 categories
- **Urgency classification ensemble** (90%+ F1 score on training data)
- **FastAPI backend** with real-time WebSocket support
- **RESTful API endpoints** for triage, queue management, and analysis

### Technical Achievements
- **Data Pipeline**: Complete preprocessing with 73 features
- **NLP Models**: Symptom extractor + urgency classifier
- **API**: `/triage`, `/queue`, `/analyze` endpoints functional
- **Real-time**: WebSocket support for live updates
- **Species Support**: Dogs, cats, rabbits, birds, hamsters, guinea pigs

### Next Priority Items
1. **Frontend Dashboard** - React interface for clinic staff
2. **Database Integration** - PostgreSQL for persistent storage
3. **Authentication** - OAuth 2.0 implementation
4. **Cloud Deployment** - AWS/Azure setup
5. **Real Data** - Acquire actual veterinary records for training

### Completion Status
- **Core ML Pipeline**: 85% complete
- **Backend API**: 70% complete
- **Frontend**: 0% (not started)
- **Production Readiness**: 25%
- **Overall Project**: 30% complete
